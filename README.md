# Monogame.Retro

Monogame.Retro will be a C# wrapper around the libretro API

# libretro

libretro is an API that exposes the core of a retro gaming system.
A frontend for libretro handles video output, audio output and input.
A libretro core written in portable C or C++ can run seamlessly on many platforms.

# Note

I don't really know what I'm doing here so don't expect any fast progress, it's a learning experience for me

# Requirements

I've started working in Windows so everything else it's untested

- Monogame (not currently needed, there is a Monogame project but doesn't do anything yet)
- Monodevelop
